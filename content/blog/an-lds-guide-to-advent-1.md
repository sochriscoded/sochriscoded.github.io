> "*Almighty God, give us grace to cast away the works of darkness, and put on the armor of light, now in the time of this mortal life in which your Son Jesus Christ came to visit us in great humility; that in the last day, when he shall come again in his glorious majesty to judge both the living and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal; through him who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.*"
> - The Collect for the First Sunday in Advent, Book of Common Prayer



My ancestor, John Linford, was born in the quiet countryside of Gravely, England. This would change when missionaries for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints would arrive and would convert John and his family to the faith. They would be one among many converts across the pond and would stay in England for a few years longer. 

However, due to a disdain for Mormonism, a growing pride in Anglicanism (which in turn was experiencing its own upheaval with the [Oxford Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Movement)) and a desire to join the other members of the LDS church in Utah, John and his family packed up their belongings, and emigrated to the United States, slowly making their way to the edges of the known and settled world for white Americans: Iowa City. 

While many Mormon pioneering groups had successfully traversed the difficult and windy steppes of the North American Great Plains, changes from covered wagons to handcarts, to save on costs for poor English LDS Saints, as well as mismanagement would eventually lead to tragedy for John and his family. In fall of 1856, lack of preparation led the Willie and Martin Handcart companies to Omaha, Nebraska, where the groups debated persisting on to Utah in the deep winter snow, or to wait until spring. Eager to be with the other saints in Salt Lake, 404 individuals, including John and his family, would persist through the bitter cold and wind. 

It was clear this was a disaster waiting to happen, and other smaller teams who had passed them rushed to the Salt Lake Valley in order to get assistance to the beleaguered group. However, before help could arrive, food supply had run out, the cold of October had settled in, and the party began to language. It was along the Sweetwater river, just shy of the continental divide and the most difficult stretch of the entire journey: Rocky Ridge.

John had developed a sickness in Iowa City, and the harsh cold had only diminished his ability, little by little, until just hours before a rescue party led by my future mission president's ancestor, Ezra Hanks, would arrive, John passed away. His last words have been memorialized by the Late LDS Prophet Thomas S. Monson: 

> "I am glad we came. I shall not live to reach Salt Lake, but you and the boys will, and I do not regret all we have gone through if our boys can grow up and raise their families in Zion." - John Linford, as Quoted by Thomas S. Monson, 2016, the Ensign(Liahona) magazine.

John never lost his hope and his faith in his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. His wish would be fulfilled as his wife and children would reach Salt Lake City November 15th, 1856.

## A Light to Lighten the Darkness





In 2021, I found myself wandering in my own cold and bitter journey. I had become both obsessed with LDS history and thoroughly disenchanted by the leadership, actions, and beliefs of that faith. Doubts had plagued me as did unanswerable questions that ranged from questions of the authenticity regarding the book of mormon and other works like the pearl of great price, as well as much more painful questions of the nature of evil, the purpose of life, the meaning hope in a world that felt increasingly hopeless and meaningless.

The result of years of these types of questions resulted in me determining to become at first “Physically In, Mentally Out” of the LDS church, and then “Physically Out, Mentally Out.” The spiritual void left in its wake caused me to feel adrift and hopeless in a way that I had not felt, and whose effects persist from time to time to this day.

It was during this time of my life that I was encouraged by an acquaintance to attend The Episcopal Church, a daughter church of the Church of England, the self-same church my late ancestor John Linford had once been a part of. Above all, I found myself drawn to the liturgy outlined in the Book of Common Prayer, the missal, prayer book, lectionary, psalter, and handbook of the Anglican Communion. 

I have always been a liturgical soul. There isn’t much liturgy in Mormonism, at least not out in the open. The only set prayers are the sacrament prayers, and while one might say that the form of a sacrament service rarely changes, it is very “low church” with not much prescription as to how those services may be run.

This contrasts heavily with an LDS temple: The Ordinances are highly symbolic, with a lot of set movement, dress, prayers, collects, and litanies. Critics might call this “cultish” but I find it no more “cultish” than I have attending a Traditional Latin Mass or a high church “Smells and Bells” Episcopal Communion.

And yet, it is this form of worship I was drawn to in the depths of my wandering. I found peace in the Morning and Evening Office, hope in the Anglican “rosary” and joy in the Liturgical Calendar. It was also significant to me, that I found this all during the season of Advent, a season those of us who live in the USA often forget even exists.

##  “It Doesn’t Feel Like Christmas At All”

A common refrain you will hear from time to time, and I do believe it is true is “Christmas doesn’t feel the same anymore.” From the lack of warm, incandescent lights, the garish consumerism that has become blase in recent years, the constant encroaching of green and red before we have even planned our halloween costumes, and the general sense of despair or hopelessness that some people feel has become a touchstone of the modern day bleeds out the colors we put up. 

Is it any surprise then that we metaphorically struggle to find light in the growing darkness of the winter when we too, struggle to find the point of a christmas tree in a world that seems so void of authenticity?

Chances are if you are LDS, you don’t have a strong connection to the liturgical year. You see, for 1500+ years, the Christian church has been governed by the seasons of the church. For the church at large, the religious year begins on the First Sunday of Advent, not on January 1st. This is because there is a season most of us forgot about, that is not secular because it produces very little profit and thus does not hold value to the culturemaking aspects of society, but it is the key that has held the idea of Christmas in place for over 1000 years. This season is Advent.

The general christian calendar is split up by set times in the year: Lent starts 40 days before Easter, the “easter season” lasts 40 days before Pentecost, which is also known as “ordinary time” and is the largest season in the whole year. Within the seasons are feast days (literally “Holy Days” which we shortened to “Holidays”) which celebrate an event in the scriptures, a person (like the life of an apostle or some other figure), or commemorates some aspect of doctrine that is foundational to Christianity.

And yet, in the United States, a particularly protestant and exceptionally puritan-based Evangelical branch of protestant at that, most holidays and liturgical seasons have been cast aside along with tradition and old world culture. This has, by and large, allowed corporations to set the tone and mood for the seasons of the year. Most of the previously religious holidays (including some pagan ones like Samhain) have been profoundly hollowed out, glossed over with plastic and cheap material, and sold back to us, the consumer, for a hefty price. 

Christmas as we know it was not fully realized until the 1950’s making "nostalgic" Christmas a very modern and non-historical thing. Prior to the 1950’s, christmas was just 1 day in a series of days that ended on January 6th: Epiphany, or 3 King’s Day. These 12 days of christmas,  were all holy days and were meant to be time off and away from work. Epiphany was no different and there is a reason some people call it “little christmas.”

However, with the removal of Advent and the 12 days of Christmastide from the american zeitgiest, nothing was stopping christmas from encroaching further and further into the month of november. With a need for profit, there is an active incentive for corporations to promote the gift-giving, joyful, and nostalgic season as early as possible. 

The end result of this is creating a season that is just as cheap and hollow as gilding. It glitters with all of the whimsy of a splendid palace, but underneath is cheap plastic and particle board.

The question remains, how do we escape this and find an truly meaningful christmas in a world that may seem to feel so full of darkness? I propose that we find a return to Advent, a connection to true tradition, and a depth in the historic liturgy that has bound the church together for over a millennium.

## Advent for LDS Folks, A Prayer Book for LDS Folks

We’re going to spend the next 4 weeks slowing down, contemplating the meaning of the Savior, His Atonement, and how the Christmas Season really falls into that. But really, what this truly is about is introducing to you, dear member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to a new way and form of prayer. This will be both familiar and unfamiliar, holy and almost too formal. Repetitive and extemporaneous. It will feel like a paradox and a natural, logical form of prayer all at once.

We will start simple, a set prayer structure here (we call that a liturgy), a set of scripture readings there, and we’ll start to build upon what we think prayer is, how it can be done, and how we can enhance our spiritual lives. We’ll think about the Christian year, about the Holy Days you gain when you start seeing Christians as your spiritual cousins, rather than your spiritual enemies, about the role Jesus plays  in your life, and in the lives of the people around you, about the commonalities that you share, not the differences you have (trust me, there is more in common than you might realize!) Most importantly, we’ll learn that faith isn’t just what we feel or say, it is what we do and how we act. In the words of St. John Chrysosom:

> *If you cannot find Christ in the beggar at the church door,*
> *you will not find Him in the chalice.*

Most of all, I promise that as you consider the Advent season as a special time to prepare, you will arrive at Christmas Day, the Feast of the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ, All the more happy, all the more refreshed, all the more ready for 12 days of joy, happiness, and love.

May you have a blessed, happy, and contemplative Advent.
