## What is a Network

Think of the most important inventions that came about through the advent of World War 2. You might think of the Enigma Machine, or the Atom Bomb, but something often overlooked, but just as important, was the fire control system.

Before WW2, ships guns would fire independently, but were coordinated by a rangefinder. However, humans make mistake and can calculated incorrectly. As a result, the ability to shoot more accurately, more in concert, and effectively became a paramount, immediate need for the researchers at Bell Labs.

One such research in was George Stibitz. A Dr. of Mathematical Physics, Stibitz was no stranger to solving unique, complex problems. One such problem was determining how a mechanical computing machine could be used to compute a varity of complex numbers like *i*.

In doing so, he created the very first computer-to-computer network.

He wanted a way to z
