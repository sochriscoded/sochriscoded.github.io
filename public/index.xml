      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-go&#34;&gt;Why Go&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world overflowing with programming languages, Go (or Golang) stands out not just for what it does,but for why it was created in the first place. Born at Google in the late 2000s, Go was forged in the fires of frustration. Its creators,Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson, were all veterans of systems programming and distributed systems, and they were growing weary of the complex build times, clunky dependency management, and lack of scalability in existing languages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the 1930&amp;rsquo;s, two indepentent mathematicians, Leonid Kantorovich and Wassily Leontief were busy producing something that would be overlooked for decades: The true and practical application of linear equations in an increasingly modern, increasingly mechanical world. While their groundbreaking work was overlooked by peers like Alan Turing and John Von Neumann, both of whom would have profound impact on the world of mathematics and computer science, Kantorovich and Leontief&amp;rsquo;s work would nontheless be just as important in our modern age as Turing&amp;rsquo;s and von Neumann&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>02 Hello World</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Go was initially designed, it was built with the intent of being a &amp;ldquo;Modern C&amp;rdquo; or a reimagining of what C would be like, had it been invented in the Year of our Lord Alan Turing, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go is a compiled, strongly typed, multi-paradigmed, garbage-collected language that focuses on simplicity and speed rather than a vast type system, or single-paradigm behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has recieved critical acclaim as well as criticism from throughout the community but its nature has lent itself well to becoming a solid choice for backend, service-centered architecture, while remaining fast and memory-safe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>02 Matricies in Linear Systems</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;matrices-makes-things-simpler&#34;&gt;Matrices Makes Things Simpler!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a new linear system:&lt;/p&gt;
$$\begin{cases}-\frac{1}{2}x + 3y + \frac{1}{8}z = \frac{17}{2} \\ 5x + 12y - 8z = 14 \\ x + 2z = 10 \end{cases}$$&lt;p&gt;While this is pretty trival and graphing it is no issue now thanks to 3d calculators, its difficult to envision a 4th or 5th dimension in which to find the point. From about here, we need to start to look at our linear equations strictly as that. But having all of these extra letters and operators tend to get in the way of our math, as what we are really doing our math on isn&amp;rsquo;t our unknown variables, rather we are doing the math on the &lt;em&gt;coefficients&lt;/em&gt; next to the variables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;welcome-to-flatland&#34;&gt;Welcome to Flatland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions&lt;/em&gt; is a satirical novel by the English educator and priest the Reverand Edwind Abbott Abbott. What was initially a satire on victorian standards and culture wound up becoming a mathematical classic, exploring the relationship between 1d, 2d, and 3d spaces. At the same time, a near-contemporary of Rev. Abbott, the famed mathematician Bernhard Reimann was making significant contributions to the world of mathematics. One such contribution is the famous &amp;ldquo;Reimann Hypothesis.&amp;rdquo; Without scaring or boring you, Reimann wanted to explore the relationship between numbers and most importantly, why prime numbers are where they are. To do so, Reimann had to explore a kind of cordinante system that you and I might not be familiar with: The complex plane.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
