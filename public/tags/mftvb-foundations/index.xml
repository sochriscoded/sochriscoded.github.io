      <description>&lt;p&gt;For much of the late Mercantile to the end of the pre-industrial revolution era, formal education, as we understand it today, it did not really exist for the common person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average person would receive a bare bones education in their childhood if they were lucky and had an adequate enough school teacher or parents who had time and energy to devote to teaching them, they would learn how to read and write and do common arithmetic. If a student was lucky enough, they might have had the chance to go to a finishing school or boarding school, receive more education in the arts, science, and mathematics beyond just simple arithmetic, and eventually either go into a business, or continue to a form of higher education.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
