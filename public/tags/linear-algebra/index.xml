      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;matrices-makes-things-simpler&#34;&gt;Matrices Makes Things Simpler!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a new linear system:&lt;/p&gt;
$$\begin{cases}-\frac{1}{2}x + 3y + \frac{1}{8}z = \frac{17}{2} \\ 5x + 12y - 8z = 14 \\ x + 2z = 10 \end{cases}$$&lt;p&gt;While this is pretty trival and graphing it is no issue now thanks to 3d calculators, its difficult to envision a 4th or 5th dimension in which to find the point. From about here, we need to start to look at our linear equations strictly as that. But having all of these extra letters and operators tend to get in the way of our math, as what we are really doing our math on isn&amp;rsquo;t our unknown variables, rather we are doing the math on the &lt;em&gt;coefficients&lt;/em&gt; next to the variables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
