      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the 1930&amp;rsquo;s, two indepentent mathematicians, Leonid Kantorovich and Wassily Leontief were busy producing something that would be overlooked for decades: The true and practical application of linear equations in an increasingly modern, increasingly mechanical world. While their groundbreaking work was overlooked by peers like Alan Turing and John Von Neumann, both of whom would have profound impact on the world of mathematics and computer science, Kantorovich and Leontief&amp;rsquo;s work would nontheless be just as important in our modern age as Turing&amp;rsquo;s and von Neumann&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
