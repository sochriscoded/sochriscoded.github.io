      01 What People Get Wrong About Math
    </h1>

  </header> 
  <div class="post-content"><p>More than likely, this will be added to the introduction video, but I did want to provide an overview of our foundation series. We often see the things we learn in math class as disconnected ideas that don&rsquo;t seem to make sense. By and large, much of what we learn in math doesn&rsquo;t actually start to make any amount of sense as to why we are learning it until we learn calculus, at which point most people have already become disconnected to math and believe it &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, I disagree that there are &ldquo;math people&rdquo; and &ldquo;not math&rdquo; people. I am not a good visual artist naturally, however this is a skill I could work on and develop, despite my lack of natural gift. What I need is the right teacher and the right reasources to learn with. Oh, and lots of practice. Now, yes, in the context of math, this means solving math problems, but I don&rsquo;t think you should burden yourself with so many problems that you start to overwhelm yourself.</p>
<p>The goal of math problems are to help you understand and practice. They should be to help you be creative and enjoy the problem-solving process. Too easily we have turned these math problems into something we fear, rather than something we should look forward to. That being said, do math problems, try them, get to be familiar with the question and then attempt to solve them. If you are wrong, then break down the steps and see where you went wrong.</p>
<p>This does a couple of things: It helps you become familiar with the problem-solving process. It develops your problem-solving skills that you can use in your job elsewhere. Do you work as a mechanic? That&rsquo;s perfect! Much of what you do IS problems solving. Do you stock shelves, work in a store, or work food service? Learning problem-solving can help you identify issues at your workplace and will teach you how to solve those problems head-on, building your relationship with your leadership and your team. I&rsquo;m not saying it will result in more money, but it could result in reconition and chances for leadershp (and hopefully more income!)</p>
<p>With that being said, let&rsquo;s look at our roadmap for the foundations series.</p>
<h2 id="foundations-1-numbers-and-working-with-numbers">Foundations 1: Numbers and Working With Numbers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#foundations-1-numbers-and-working-with-numbers">#</a></h2>
<p>Our first foundations will involve working with numbers. Numbers are the ABCs of math. And like relearning our ABCs, it might feel trivial, almost childish, to relearn our numbers. But like learning a second language, you cannot escape learning new grammer, new pronunciation, and new words that might not fit in the vocabulary you are used to.</p>
<p>Similarly, numbers are quite simple on their face, but once we start to dig into the history and meaning behind numbers, we quickly learn that there is depth and richness that we weren&rsquo;t able to grasp when we were younger. Just like how simple board books and children&rsquo;s shows might mean one thing when we are young, but it gains new meaning once we become the parents.</p>
<p>Likewise, the simple things we learned as children may not have made sense then, but with some time and frontal lobe growth, we can begin to see why things work the way that they do. We&rsquo;ll revisit our old friend PEMDAS, fractions, factoring, and relearn the difference between whole numbers and integers and even relearn some arithmatic techniques you might have gotten hung up on as a student. Don&rsquo;t worry! These are not the end all be all of math! We&rsquo;ll break out of this.</p>
<h2 id="foundations-2-basic-algebra-and-putting-numbers-to-shapes">Foundations 2: Basic Algebra and Putting Numbers to Shapes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#foundations-2-basic-algebra-and-putting-numbers-to-shapes">#</a></h2>
<p>With the building blocks of the language of math explored, we can start to examine the next level up: Algebra. Elementary Algebra sets us up to examine the question &ldquo;What if we don&rsquo;t know something in an equation we are working with?&rdquo; This idea of an unknown <em>variable</em> is so important that it will crop up for the remainder of our study. Therefore, its important we get a good grasp of how to work with these sorts of variables. We&rsquo;ll learn how to graph them visually and what kind of properties these expressions have.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also deep dive into the visual world, exploring truths about geometry, as well as learning how to use math in our daily lives, whether we are framing, working on our car, doing electrical work, or if we are sitting down at a desk job. Again, the goal here is learning how to problem-solve, rather than memorizing formulas. If you study math correctly, you won&rsquo;t need to memorize things. You&rsquo;ll just be able to reason about the world around you and draw conclusions from there. In short, math can give you a rather potent superpower if studied the way you a math teacher actually wants to teach it.</p>
<h2 id="integrated-math">Integrated Math<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#integrated-math">#</a></h2>
<p>Our next 3 sections will follow what is typically called the &ldquo;Integrated Math Route.&rdquo; Outside of the USA, the integrated math system is the most prevelant, with some states</p>
